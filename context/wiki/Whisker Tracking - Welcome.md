Welcome!
========

Whisk is a cross-platform package for fully automated tracking of single rows of whiskers in high-speed video. It consists of a set of command-line utilities and a graphical interface for semi-automated tracking. [Python](https://web.archive.org/web/20160913010927/http://www.python.org/) and [Matlab](https://web.archive.org/web/20160913010927/http://www.mathworks.com/) interfaces are also provided. Whisk can read [StreamPix SEQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20160913010927/http://www.norpix.com/products/streampix5/streampix5.php) and [TIFF](https://web.archive.org/web/20160913010927/http://www.libtiff.org/document.html) as well as any video format that [FFMPEG](https://web.archive.org/web/20160913010927/http://www.ffmpeg.org/) can decode.
